(Semi-Automated Vulnerability Scanner and Massive Enumeration Tool/Interpreter For Automateing Standard Tools)
XFramework aims to automate Most of Routine Network/WebApplication Information Gathering, Enumeration and Vulnerability Scanning

 # History
The Basic Framework(Scripts) Have Been Developed Around 2015/2016 in Python2/Ruby/Perl and It has Distributed in Some Forums and Among Some Local P.Testers by name of "XMass-Attacker Scripts" with limited Automated Enumeration Tools and Also Exploitation Recommendation. Since The old Version was Kind of Out-of-Date and Not Very Friendly(Flexible) i decided to Write a completely New framework from Scratch.
